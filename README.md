# JWT-Based Authentication System ‚Äì Contacts Manager

* Engineered a secure authentication system using React for the frontend, with JWT-based user registration, login, and secure logout, leveraging bcrypt for password hashing, all within an Express.js and MongoDB backend architecture.
* Crafted a responsive user dashboard in React with Material UI for CRUD operations on contacts, available exclusively to authenticated users, complete with custom error handling to enhance reliability and user experience.
* Implemented JWT strategies for secure token management, including generation, validation, and storage in HTTP-only cookies to protect against CSRF and XSS attacks, utilizing Express.js middleware for robust backend security.
* Integrated Axios interceptors in the React frontend to monitor authentication status, alongside protected routes to ensure user session integrity, guaranteeing a seamless and secure navigation experience.
